# Website Category Classification

**A machine learning project that classifies websites into categories based on their textual content using Python, TF-IDF vectorization, and Logistic Regression.**

## üìù Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete text classification pipeline:  

- **Text preprocessing** and cleaning  
- **Feature extraction** with TF-IDF  
- **Label encoding** for categorical targets  
- **Model selection and hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV`  
- **Evaluation** with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  

The model predicts the category of a website based on its content, useful for content organization, search optimization, and automated website tagging.
